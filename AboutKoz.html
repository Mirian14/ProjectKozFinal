			enjoys serving you fresh, hot from the oven pizza wherever you are. Pizza maker Kevin Kozlowski, long known

			has 5 Pizza food trucks spread across the Carolinas.</p>
		<p>Our <em>mission</em> is to bring satisfaction in the form of delicious, hand-crafted pizzas made from the
			freshest, quality ingredients. Stop to enjoy some of our pizza during lunch with your co-workers or after
			your happy hour with your <cite>family and friends</cite>!<img class="img-float-right"
